# cassandra-pv-archiver

This repository is a Git mirror of the [Cassandra PV Archiver][] published
by aquenos GmbH und the terms of the [Eclipse Public License v1.0][].

The individual release files of the source code were added as individual
commits to the repository.
A separate branch (`mirror-tools`) contains the tools used to programmatically
create this mirror repository.
Although this repository is mostly a mirror of the "Cassandra PV Archiver" versions,
the releases of the older Cassandra CSS Archiver were also added as first commits
as a reference.
The dates of the commits are forged to be equivalent to the original publication
of the respective release.
