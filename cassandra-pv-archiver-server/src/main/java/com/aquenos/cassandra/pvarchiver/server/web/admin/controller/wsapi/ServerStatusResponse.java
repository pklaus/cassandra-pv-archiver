     *            human-readable name of the Cassandra cluster to which this
     *            server is connected. May be <code>null</code> if the server is
     *            currently not connected to a Cassandra cluster. In this case,
     *            <code>cassandraError</code> is not <code>null</code>.
     * @param cassandraError
     *            error message indicating a problem that occurred while trying
     *            to connect to the Cassandra cluster. This is <code>null</code>
     *            if there is no problem.
     * @param cassandraKeyspaceName
     *            name of the Cassandra keyspace which is used by the Cassandra
     *            PV Archiver. May be <code>null</code> if the server is
     *            currently not connected to a Cassandra cluster. In this case,
     *            <code>cassandraError</code> is not <code>null</code>.
     * @param channelsDisconnected
     *            number of channels that are in the disconnected state.
     * @param channelsError
     *            number of channels that are in the error state.
     * @param channelsTotal
     *            total number of channels on this server. If the server has not
     *            been initialized yet (e.g. because it cannot connect to the
     *            database), this number is zero, even if there are channels
     *            that belong to the server.
     * @param serverId
     *            ID of the server.
     * @param serverLastOnlineTime
     *            last time this server successfully registered itself with the
     *            cluster. The time is specified as the number of milliseconds
     *            since January 1st, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. This number might be
     *            zero if the server has not successfully registered itself with
     *            the cluster since it was started.
     * @param serverName
     *            human-readable name of the server. Typically, this is the
     *            hostname of the server.
     * @param serverOnline
     *            flag indicating whether the server considers itself to be
     *            online. The server considers itself online when a sufficient
     *            amount of time has passed since successfully registering with
     *            the cluster and the renewal of the registration has not failed
     *            since.
     * @param totalSamplesDropped
     *            total number of samples that have been dropped (discarded) by
     *            this server because they arrived to quickly and could not be
     *            written in time. This counter is reset when the server is
     *            restarted.
     * @param totalSamplesWritten
     *            total number of samples that have been written (persisted) by
     *            this server. This counter is reset when the server is
     *            restarted.
